CloudPAD

Cloud hosted application connects to MinIO, running in containers alongside MongoDB on Raspberry Pi 4. Cloud compute instance runs a container of the app itself and WireGuard, which allows raspberry Pi to connect to the cloud network.

This project was made with personal use in mind, so my configuration might not work for others.
